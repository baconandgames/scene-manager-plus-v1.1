extends Node

## The SceneManager class is designed to enable simple one-line calls to load one scene (Node)
## and unload another. It also handles monitoring load progress, which can displayed as a loading
## bar to the user and it gives you optional transitions for swapping between them. Data can also 
## be handed off between scenes by implementing methods within the scenes being loaded/unloaded (see 
## [method _on_content_finished_loading] for more detail. The inteded use is to switch between major
## screens (like Start and Gameplay and GameOver) or between levels. SceneManager CAN be used to load
## other assets, but it's not intended to manage loading frequently used items like spawning enemies
## or bullets. This is for high-level game management. [br][br]
## This version, revised from v1.0 seen described here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2uYaoQj_6o0
## aims to add an often requested feature, which is to define where content is loaded (instead of simply
## replacing the SceneTree as v1.0 did. v1.0 was designed that way to make it simple to explain and use, 
## but folks ask for more control so v1.1 was born! Additionally, this updated heavily decouples
## game logic from the SceneManager to make it easier to utilize in your own game. There are no more
## class type checks within the SceneManager. Instead, I've opted to use has_method checks that
## loaded classes may optionall implement to react to the loading process without having to change
## SceneManager to suit your game's internal code. There are also now signals you can listen for to
## easily make changes to your SceneTree at different moments during the loading progress, again allowing
## classes using SceneManager to react to the process instead of having to insert that logic into the SceneManager
## iteslf. There are certainly tradeoffs to this method, but hey that's programming. You may 
## edit this to suit your needs. I tried to strike a balance between keeping the code fairly flexible
## without abstracting it so far that it would be hard to follow or asking users to pass in too many
## arugments when loading a scene. [br][br]
## [b]One Final Note[/b] Despite this leveraging the [ResourceLoader] class to monitor loading,
## SceneManager does not at this time support treaded loading. The current system will simply reject 
## loading an asset if one is already in progress. Managing multiple concurrent items was out of the
## scope of v.1.1 but may be implemented in future versions. Be mindful of how frequently a user might 
## be able to take action that triggers SceneManager to load something as it will fail silently right now
## (the previous version had this limitation). Aside from accounting for this in your logic, a workaround
## could be to check [code]_loading_in_progress == true[/code] and if so [code]await SceneManager.load_complete[/code]
## in cases where you might be at risk of using SceneManager to load scenes in rapid succession. This
## approach will have limitations as well. The way I intended SceneManager for my own use, this will rarely
## if ever, be an issue, which is why that was an acceptable limitation. Just something to be aware of.

var _loading_screen_scene:PackedScene = preload("res://Menus/loading_screen.tscn")	## reference to loading screen PackedScene
var _loading_screen:LoadingScreen	## internal - reference to loading screen instance
var _transition:String	## internal - transition being used for current load
var _zelda_transition_direction:Vector2	## internal - direction of zelda transition (should only be passed Vector2.UP/RIGHT/DOWN/LEFT) Is passed in when calling [code]swap_scenes_zelda()[/code]
var _content_path:String	## internal - stores the path to the asset SceneManager is trying to load
var _load_progress_timer:Timer	## internal - Timer used to check in on load progress
var _load_scene_into:Node	## internal - Node into which we're loading the new scene, defaults to [code]get_tree().root[/code] if left [code]null[/null] 
var _scene_to_unload:Node	## internal - Node we're unloading. In almost all cases, SceneManager will be used to swap between two scenes - after all that it the primary focus. However, passing in [code]null[/code] for the scene to unload will skip the unloading process and simply add the new scene. This isn't recommended, as it can have some adverse affects depending on how it is used, but it does work. Use with caution :)
var _loading_in_progress:bool = false	## internal - used to block SceneManager from attempting to load two things at the same time

## Currently only being used to connect to required, internal signals
func _ready() -> void:
	_content_invalid.connect(_on_content_invalid)
	_content_failed_to_load.connect(_on_content_failed_to_load)
	_content_finished_loading.connect(_on_content_finished_loading)

## internal - adds the loading screen. The loading screen is added to the [code]root[/code]. 
## To make changes to where the loading screen ends up, you can listen for the signals [code]scene_added[/code] 
## and [code]load_complete[/code] to reposition loading screen or other elements, relative to the 
## loading screen appropriately. [br][br]
## For example, the following code from Gameplay (a sample "game manager" of sorts) listens for these
## signals and and then makes adjustments to the SceneTree to keep the HUD always above the loading screen
## [codeblock]
##	func _on_load_start(_loading_screen):
##	pass
##	# keep HUD on top of loading screen
##	_loading_screen.reparent(self)
##	move_child(_loading_screen,hud.get_index())
## [/codeblock]
## This may seem an odd way to do this, but the alternative is having set properties at the SceneManager level
## before loading asset OR having yet another parameter to pass in (several if you want to options to control
## where in the scene tree or relative to which node you want to put it. By simply listening for this event,
## you can write any logic you want and handle it as needed without having to change SceneManager to suit your specific needs :)

## Slight variation on swap_scenes that will result in a sliding, Zelda-dungeon-style transition between scenes[br][br]
## [b]Note:[/b] This version of SceneManager assumes that all levels are the same size (defined above as [code]LEVEL_H[/code] and [code]LEVEL_W[/code]
## If your game uses levels that vary in size, you will likely need to modify this method call to accept arguments
## that define the size of incoming and outgoing scenes and modify the tweens in in the Zelda block in the middle of
## [code]_on_content_finished_loading[/code] to properly set up the start/finish locations of the two scenes.
## Future versions of this SceneManager may account for this that flexibility was out of scope for this pass.

## I'll do my best to assist if you get stuck :)

func _on_content_invalid(path:String) -> void:

## internal - fires when content is done loading. This is responsible for data transfer, adding the incoming scene
## removing the outgoing scene, hanlding the zelda transition (if of that type), halting the game until the 
## out transition finishes, and also fires off the signals you can listen for to manage the SceneTree as things
## are added. These will also be useful for initializing things before the user gains control after a transition
## as well as controlling when the user can resume control[br][br]
## [b]A Few Examples[/b][br]
## [b][color=plum]load_start[/color][/b] allows you to trigger something as soon as the loading screen is added to the tree, like for example playing a sound effect[br]	
## [b][color=plum]scene_added[/color][/b] triggers after the incoming scene is added to the tree, useful for rearraging your scene tree to make sure the loading screen stays on top of everything or perhaps keeping your HUD above the loading screen. The world is your oyster, friend! You can also initialize stuff here before passing control back to the user, because at this stage the transition hasn't finished yet[br]	
## [b][color=plum]load_complete[/color][/b] triggers at the end of _on_content_finished_loading, I use this to return control to the player[br][br]
## [b]Methods that a scene loaded through SceneManager can optionall implement[/b][br]
## [b][color=plum]get_data[/color][/b] a scene should implement this if you want a scene to expose data to pass to an incoming scene[br]	
## [b][color=plum]receive_data[/color][/b] a scene should implement this if you want that scene to be able to receive data from the outgoing scene. It is recommended that you check the data type of the incoming data to make sure it's of a type the incoming scene wants. If not, simply discard or don't set the data. This allows you to control which classes can send/receive information without having to worry about running into data mismatches. Think of it like an internal version of the "has_method" check.[br]	
## [b][color=plum]init_scene[/color][/b] implement this to be able to execute code (like initializing stuff based on what was passed in through receive_data) - this should fire before the _ready method of the scene[br]	
## [b][color=plum]start_scene[/color][/b] implement this to kick off your scene. I use it to return control to the player. But you could also trigger events with the scene or anything else you want to hold until loading and transitioning are both totally done.[br][br]
